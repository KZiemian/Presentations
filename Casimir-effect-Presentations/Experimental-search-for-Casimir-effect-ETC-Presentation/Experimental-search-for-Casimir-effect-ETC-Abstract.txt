"Experimental search for Casimir effect. An overview"

Among theoretical physicists the Casimir effect is a well known physical phenomenon, but when theoretical models are usually taught in various courses on quantum physics, experimental investigations of it are often neglected. Because this effect appears when an object easily seen with the naked eye interacts with a quantum electromagnetic field, measuring it is very challenging and simple theoretical models are often not very useful, when it comes to provide background for experimental data. In this talk we provide a short survey of a few of the most important experiments that tried to measure it, their failures, challenges and successes, from 1958 to the current day and some glimpse of possible future.
