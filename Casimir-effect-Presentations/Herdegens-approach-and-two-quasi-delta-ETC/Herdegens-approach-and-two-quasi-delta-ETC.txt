"Heredegen's approach to Casimir effect in application the two quasi-delta system"

In the talk we present a short introduction to the algebraic approach to Casimir effect developed by Herdegen and results obtained within this framework for a system of quantum scalar field and two quasi-delta systems. This approach interprets Casimir force as a backreaction of the quantum system to adiabatic changes of macroscopic conditions that need to be weak enough to leave algebraic properties of the system unchanged. When these conditions are fulfilled, the investigated effect can be computed without any need for removing suspicious infinities. As will be also discussed, two results for quasi-delta systems show big differences with those found in more traditional approaches to the problem. Full understanding of these discrepancies is still an open problem.
