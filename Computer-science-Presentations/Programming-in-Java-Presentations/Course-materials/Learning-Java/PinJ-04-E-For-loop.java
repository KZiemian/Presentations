	// 2) loop condition: i < 5;

	// In Java, if you need variable for counting how many times your
	// loop body executions was exectured, you should always define
	// it as above, in initialization part of the loop. Such variable
	// is in most cases named "i".

	// Variable defined in initialization part of for loop exists ONLY
	// inside the loop. Not before and not after.

	// System.out.println("Before for loop.");
	// System.out.println("i == " + i + ".");
