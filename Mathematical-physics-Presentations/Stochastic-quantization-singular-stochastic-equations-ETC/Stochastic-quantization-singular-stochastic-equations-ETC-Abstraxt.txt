Stochastic quantization, singular stochastic equations and works of Paweł Duch

From the point of view of mathematical physics quantum field theory is in very unsatisfying shape. While on a pragmatic level produces astonishingly well predictions and gives us incredible insights inside the various phenomena, its formalism is full of loopholes. While various ingenious procedures were developed to circumvent the problems taking source from lack of such solid foundations, from a mathematical physics point of view, this cannot be judged as a satisfactory situation. In recent years developments in theory of singular stochastic equations were the leading source of new results in mathematical theory of quantum fields. In this two part talk, first we explain in an informal manner how quantum fields are connected to singular stochastic equations. Motivated by that, we review some recent results in a letter field by Paweł Duch, a former member of the Field Theory Departament.
