Stochastic quantization and singular stochastic equations

From the perspective of mathematical physics, quantum field theory is in a highly unsatisfactory state. Although, on a pragmatic level, it produces remarkably accurate predictions and offers profound insights into various phenomena, its formalism is riddled with loopholes. Numerous ingenious procedures have been devised to circumvent problems arising from the lack of solid foundations; however, from the standpoint of mathematical physics, this cannot be regarded as a satisfactory situation. In recent years, developments in the theory of singular stochastic equations have become a leading source of new results in the mathematical theory of quantum fields. In this two-part talk, we first explain, in an informal manner, how quantum fields are connected to singular stochastic equations. Motivated by this, we then review some recent results in this area by Paweł Duch.
